* a directed network, in which case the model is a variation of the BA model
* described in <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0408391">
http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0408391</a>. In both cases, the number of the
* initial set of nodes is the same as the degree parameter, and no links are
* added. The first added node is connected to all of the initial nodes,
* and after that the BA model is used normally.
