/**
* Prints information about ball expansion. It uses {@value #PAR_N} nodes to
* collect statistics.
* If parameter {@value #PAR_STATS} is defined then the output is
* produced by {@link IncrementalStats#toString}, over the values of minimal
* distances from the given number of nodes to all other nodes in the network.
* If at least one node is unreachable from any selected starting node, then
* the path length is taken as infinity and statistics are calculated
* accordingly. In that case, {@link IncrementalStats#getMaxCount()} returns
* the number of nodes of "infinite distance", that is, the number of
* unreachable nodes.
* Otherwise one line is printed for all nodes we observe, containing the
* number of nodes at distance 1, 2, etc, separated by spaces.
* In this output format, unreachable nodes are simply ignored, but of course
* the sum of the numbers in one line can be used to detect partitioning if
* necessary.
* Finally, note that the {@value #PAR_N} nodes are not guaranteed to be the
* same nodes over consecutive calls to this method.
* @return always false
