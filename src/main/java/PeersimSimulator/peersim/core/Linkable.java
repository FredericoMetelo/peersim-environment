/**
* Instances of classes implementing this interface can form networks (graphs)

* The interface is similar to one of a container (containing neighbors),
* only the types of the contained elements have to be {@link Node}.
* The neighbor collection is defined in a random access list style, but
* it must follow the contract of a set too (elements must be unique).
* <p>
* Also note that there is no possibility to remove elements from the
* neighbor set. This is because removal is usually costly and it does not make
* sense in the context of our applications,
* where this interface is used for 1) initialization and 2)
* providing an interface for other protocols for accessing the neighbor list.
* Protocols that manage links remove, refresh, etc their link set internally
* or through custom methods.
* Therefore it would only put an unnecessary burden on implementors.
