 * This interface must be implemented by protocols that need to release

 * {@link Fallible#DEAD}. Recall that this fail state means that the node
 * will never get back online. However, other nodes and protocols might
 * still have references to these dead nodes and protocols, and this fact
 * is not always a bug. So implementing this interface allows for removing
 * stuff that we know is no longer necessary. Especially for linkable
 * protocols in the presence of churn, this is essential: they typically
 * have to release their links to other nodes to prevent the formation of
 * trees of removed nodes with a live reference to the root.
